        <h4>Taking your first class?</h4>
        <p>Students new to belly dance begin with a class called the "Fundamentals of Bellydance".  During this twelve week course, dancers learn the moves basic to belly dance, how to combine those moves and ways to travel across the dance floor.</p>
        <p>There are two classes to choose from: Tuesdays from 5:30pm to 6:30pm, or Wednesdays from 6:15pm to 7:15pm. The same content is taught in each class, so you can alternate between classes and remain on schedule.  If you do miss a class, it's generally not a problem as there is a lot of review built into every class.</p>
        <p>The fee for the twelve weeks is $100 for students that pay the first day of class. That is a $20 discount. If you begin during weeks two through six, and pay for the remainder of the course, the fee is $9 per class, and after that, classes are $10 each. </p>
